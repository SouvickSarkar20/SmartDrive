# ðŸš— SmartDrive  

SmartDrive is a full-stack project that demonstrates how **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** can be used to find the **shortest path** between two points.  

We use a **mock graph of locations** connected by weighted edges (distances). The backend runs **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** to compute the shortest route, and the frontend visualizes the result on a **map using Leaflet**.  

This project showcases:  
- Practical use of **DSA (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm)**  
- **Full-stack development** with React + Node.js + Express  
- **Interactive path visualization** on a map
